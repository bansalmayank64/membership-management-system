# Reactivation Fixes - Testing Guide

## 🐛 Issues Identified:
1. **NaN Date Issue**: `formatIsoToDMonYYYY` couldn't handle ISO datetime strings like `2025-09-17T00:00:00.000Z`
2. **Dropdown Default Issue**: Select component not showing the calculated default value

## 🔧 Fixes Applied:

### Fix 1: Date Formatting
- **Problem**: `'17T00:00:00.000Z'.split('-')` resulted in `NaN` when parsing day part
- **Solution**: Extract date part only by splitting on `'T'` first
- **Code**: Added check for `dateString.includes('T')` and extract date part

### Fix 2: Dropdown Selection  
- **Problem**: Select component not reflecting the calculated default value
- **Solution**: Added dynamic `key` prop to force re-render when dialog opens
- **Code**: `key={reactivation-select-${selectedItemForAction?.id}-${reactivationType}}`

### Fix 3: Debug Logging
- **Added**: Logging to track reactivationType changes
- **Added**: Debug info in dialog subtitle to show current value

## 🧪 How to Test:

### Test Date Formatting:
1. Open reactivation dialog for a student with membership end date  
2. **Expected**: Should show "17 Sep 2025" instead of "NaN Sep 2025"
3. **Check**: Both indicator box and summary section

### Test Dropdown Default:
1. Open reactivation dialog for student with recent end date (≤15 days)
2. **Expected**: Dropdown should show "Resume with Original Dates" pre-selected
3. Open reactivation dialog for student with old end date (>15 days) 
4. **Expected**: Dropdown should show "Start Fresh from Today" pre-selected

### Test Different Scenarios:
- Student with membership ended today → Should default to "Resume"
- Student with membership ended 20 days ago → Should default to "Fresh" 
- Student with no membership_till → Should default to "Fresh"

## ✅ Expected Results:
- ✅ No more "NaN" in dates
- ✅ Dropdown shows correct default selection  
- ✅ Debug info visible in dialog subtitle
- ✅ Smart 15-day rule working properly
