# New Features Added

## 1. Mark Expired Seats as Vacant

### Description
Administrators can now mark seats with expired student memberships as vacant, making them available for new student assignments.

### How it works:
- When viewing seat details for an occupied seat with an expired membership, a "Mark as Vacant" button appears
- Clicking this button will:
  - Mark the seat as available
  - Update the student record to remove seat assignment
  - Set student membership status to 'expired'
  - Refresh the seat chart to show the updated status

### Usage:
1. Navigate to the Students page
2. Click on any occupied seat with an expired membership (shown with red expiry indicator)
3. In the seat details dialog, click "Mark as Vacant" button
4. Confirm the action
5. The seat will become available and the student will be marked as unassigned

### Backend API:
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/seats/:seatNumber/mark-vacant`
- **Description**: Marks an expired seat as vacant
- **Requirements**: Seat must be occupied and membership must be expired

## 2. Add Students Without Seat Assignment (Unassigned)

### Description
Students can now be added to the system without requiring a physical seat assignment. This is useful for students who are on waiting lists or don't need a permanent seat.

### How it works:
- When adding a new student, the seat selection dropdown includes an "Unassigned" option
- Selecting "Unassigned" will:
  - Create the student record with seat_number = 'UNASSIGNED'
  - Not allocate any physical seat
  - Allow the student to be managed normally (payments, membership, etc.)
  - Enable future seat assignment when needed

### Usage:
1. Navigate to the Students page
2. Click "Add Student" button
3. Fill in student details (Name, Gender, Contact, Father's Name)
4. In the "Seat Number" dropdown, select "üìç Unassigned (No physical seat)"
5. Complete the form and submit
6. Student will be created without a physical seat assignment

### Features:
- Unassigned students can still receive payments
- Membership management works normally
- Students can be assigned to physical seats later by editing their profile
- Seat number field shows "UNASSIGNED" in the database

### Backend Changes:
- Modified student creation to accept "UNASSIGNED" as a valid seat number
- Added validation to handle unassigned seat logic
- Students with unassigned seats don't interfere with physical seat management
